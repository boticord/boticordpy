These are the open source libraries we use:
- aiohttp (https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)
- typing_extensions (https://github.com/python/typing_extensions)
- sphinx (https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx)
- furo (https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo)

These are users who have made a meaningful contribution to the development of the project:
- mxdcxt (One of the developers of the v3 module update)
- arslee07 (Updated logo of the project)

It is also important to note that some developments of Melisa (https://github.com/MelisaDev/melisa) were used in the development of the project.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the former admin staff of the BotiCord (until 06/02/2023) and the entire project community.
